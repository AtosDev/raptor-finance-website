							<h1><span>About Raptor Finance</span><img src="images/lsolo-logo.svg" /></h1>
							<p>Raptor Finance is a decentralized, financial ecosystem designed by holders for holders. Our mission is to heal planet Earth together and fight climate change! We achieve this by donating to community-chosen projects that help prevent climate change. There is no planet B, therefore we need to work together to help save Mother Earth!</p>
							<p>Here at Raptor Finance, our goal is to give the everyday person the ability to earn compounding interest by purchasing our native Raptor token and staking it on our platform.</p>
							<p>Currently in development is our RaptorSwap exchange platform that will easily compete with PancakeSwap, UniSwap, SushiSwap, and any other token swap exchange. This will be due to the quality of our interface, trading features, and our one-of-a-kind 7% burn fee for transactions (applied to buys/sells) which has been designed to combat the exchange killer known as impermanent loss.</p>
							<p>To mitigate the effects of impermanent loss, which is what other platforms suffer from, we believe holding and staking on our platform, as opposed to farming is much more effective. Therefore, we have greatly incentivized staking with no time-locks and a generous 5% APY. No time locks gives you the freedom to set up your own claiming and reinvesting schedule, effectively giving you the ability to earn compounding interest from your investment in our native token.</p>
							<p>We are also implementing additional features such as a state-of-the-art farming system, crypto lottery, and eventually one of the most adaptive NFT marketplaces.Ultimately we are the future of decentralized finance and liquidity staking, with a plan to change the world by donating part of our operating fees to community-chosen projects that help the fight against climate change.<br /></p>
							<p>We strongly believe in the power of transparent and open communities. We are convinced that this project should be at all times governed by the community, and the community should be involved in the further development of his project. By investing in Raptor Finance, you become part of that community and we will welcome you with open arms. So, make sure to join our Telegram and/or Discord server!<br /></p>

							<h3 class="name">Ismail van Essen</h3>
							<p class="title">Founder</p>
							<p class="description">Hello, my name is Ismail van Essen and I&#39;m the founder of Raptor Finance!</p>
							<p class="description">Having studied and worked in the IT field for 5 years, having also a broad and in-depth financial analysis and consulting background and being part of a management team I have an important expertise of the end-to-end processes in corporate environments.</p>
							<p class="description">Proven to be successful in transitions/mergers, projects and implementations from local countries to Bulgaria. I have the proven ability to establish, lead, manage strong relationships and I am always dedicated to getting the job done properly and efficiently, these qualities and experiences brought together have made it possible for me to successfully implement new end-to-end processes across multiple countries to globalize the processes.</p>
							<p class="description">Next to my normal job I have been in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) world for over 4 years before the 2017 bull-run. That bull-run gave me multiple valuable lessons in how markets work, and the volatility of the crypto market and I have been trading ever since. In February 2021 I came up with the idea to make the PhilosoRaptor token.</p>
							<p class="description">This to not only support the holders, traders and DeFi believers but also to help our own planet. I believe climate change is dangerous, real and I want to do my part in making our planet a better place. I believe that even if you do not believe in climate change, that you still would like to have clean air, freshwater and a plastic free ocean to swim, and for our aquatic friends to thrive. So let’s work together and make that a reality!<br /><br /></p>
