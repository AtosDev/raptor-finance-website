			<p>Raptor is launched on the Binance Smart Chain. This means that in order to buy Raptor, you need the
				Binance Coin (BNB). You can buy BNB from <a href="https://trustwallet.com/"
															target="_blank">Trustwallet</a>, Binance Smart Chain wallet
				or an exchange like Binance itself, Crypto.com, Whitebit or similar. Once you have BNB, send them to
				your wallet and <a target="_blank"

					over to PancakeSwap</a> to buy Raptor for BNB.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>Is the liquidity locked?<br/></span><img src="images/lsolo-logo.svg"/></h1>
			<p>Yes, <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf5ec7ea50fffba3e1c2ab21f9bd3a7e29d11791b523f6af36ebd1bb5e145ec6c"
					   target="_blank">we have locked the liquidity</a> until the release of Raptor Swap. At which point
				we will only unlock for testing and then immediately lock for the remainder of our existence.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>Has the founder revealed his identity?<br/></span><img src="images/lsolo-logo.svg"/></h1>

			<h1><span>Is it safe to stake my tokens to the staking website?<br/></span><img
				src="images/lsolo-logo.svg"/></h1>
			<p>Yes we have extensive security measures in place to ensure the upmost protection of our clients assets.
				Please <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xf9a3fda781c94942760860fc731c24301c83830a#code" target="_blank">review our

			<h1><span>Why is the price in my Trustwallet sometimes incorrect?<br/></span><img
				src="images/lsolo-logo.svg"/></h1>
			<p>Trustwallet derives its pricing from CoinMarketCap embedded API and this service has been known to have
				incorrect and inflated pricing on smaller tokens. One reason for this is that they don&#39;t update the
				price as frequently to save resources.<br/></p>
			<h1><span>What sets your project apart from all of the others?<br/></span><img src="images/lsolo-logo.svg"/>
			</h1>
			<p>Plain and simple; we are the only project that is planning to divert a part of the fees from our upcoming
				RaptorSwap exchange to a donation wallet that the community will use to decide what environmental
				organizations we should donate to throughout the year instead of being greedy and pocketing
				everything.<br/></p>
