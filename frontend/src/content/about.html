						We are Raptor finance a decentralized, financial ecosystem designed by holders for holders.
						Our mission is to heal planet earth and stop climate change by allowing our holders to stake
						their tokens to generate yield for themselves and ecological projects.

					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						Here at Raptor Finance our goal is to enable the everyday person with an ability to earn
						compounding interest through purchasing our native token and staking it to our platform.

					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						We are also implementing a very state of the art farming system, crypto lottery, and
						eventually one of the most adaptive NFT marketplaces.

					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						Currently in development is our RaptorSwap exchange platform that will easily compete with
						PancakeSwap, UniSwap, SushiSwap, and any other token swap exchange due to the quality of
						the interface and our one of a kind 7% burn fee for transactions (applied to buys/sells)
						which has been designed to combat the exchange killer known as impermenant loss.
					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						To mitigate the effects of impermenant loss, which is what other platforms suffer from,
						we know that it's not farming but for a majority of people to hold their tokens and stake
						them to the platform. Therefore we have greatly incentivized staking with no time-locks
						and a generous 5% APY.
					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						No time locks ensures your ability to set up your own claiming and reinvesting schedule
						effectively giving you the ability to earn compounding interest from your investment in our native token.
					</p>
					<p class="text-white">
						In resolution we are the future of decentralized finance and liquidity staking, with a plan to change
						the world by donating part of our operating fees to community driven charities.
					</p>
					<h4 class="font-weight-bold text-white mt-4">
						Community values</h4>
					<p class="text-white mb-5">
						We strongly believe in the power of a transparent and open communities. We are convinced, that this
						project should at all times governed by the community and the community should be involved in the further
						development of his project. By investing into Raptor, you become part of that community and we will
						welcome you with open arms.
