                                The DeFi world has been absolutely exploding in the 1st quarter of 2021. Concepts like
                                Yield Farming, Staking and Liquidity Mining have taken over the DeFi world with
                                participants earning by "locking" their tokens for a prescribed time, much like
                                traditional interest accounts, but with much higher yields.

                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white">
                                While generally this is a safe way to earn passive income, the above concepts have a
                                major flaw which is generally known as impermanent loss.

                            </p>
                            <h4 class="font-weight-bold text-white mt-4">The risk of impermanent loss and how we
                                mitigate it</h4>
                            <p class="text-white">
                                Simply stated, while you are farming/time-locked staking and if the value of the
                                underlying token reduces significantly while it is time-locked, the value of your total
                                account will be far less than if you had simply sold your tokens before the massive
                                downturn allowing you to take profits and rebuy back in at the lower price. This applies
                                even though you are still farming rewards.

                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white">
                                The only way to completely avoid this loss is to not farm but
                                for most people to hold onto their tokens and stake them on our platform,
                                therefore:
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white">
                                we greatly incentivise holding and no time-locks on staking.
                                while doing so, you earn up to the block interest (per 3 seconds) at a
                                community-governed rate
                                an auditable community wallet will also take part in this mechanism, generating funds to
                                donate to charities whose mission is to save the planet.
                                This is being done to not only generate rewards for us as a community but to allow a
                                foundation that has vowed to save the environment to benefit from such an amazing
                                financial system.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white">
                                The Raptor smart contract applies a 7% total tax on all transactions (buys/sells). This
                                is burned from the total supply of Raptor allowing us to deflate the inflation caused by
                                staking. This means the number of tokens in your wallet will increase perpetually as you
                                stake your Raptor and claim your rewards. This way, impermanent loss can be avoided
                                altogether and in effect you get paid for just staking Raptor.

                                years before the 2017 bull-run. That bull-run gave me multiple valuable lessons in how
                                markets work, and the volatility of the crypto market and I have been trading ever
                                since. In February 2021 I came up with the idea to make the PhilosoRaptor token.
